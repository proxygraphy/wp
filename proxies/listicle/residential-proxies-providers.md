## üß† What Are Residential Proxies?

Residential proxies are IPs assigned to real devices by ISPs. Unlike datacenter proxies, they are harder to detect and less likely to be blocked. This makes them ideal for:

- Bypassing geo-blocks
- Running multiple accounts
- Web data extraction
- SEO tracking
- Brand protection

Not everyone needs a massive enterprise-grade proxy plan. Affordable residential proxies make it easier for:

- Small businesses to scrape market data
- Social media managers to manage multiple accounts
- Digital marketers to verify ads globally

You don‚Äôt have to spend hundreds to get access to a quality proxy pool.
